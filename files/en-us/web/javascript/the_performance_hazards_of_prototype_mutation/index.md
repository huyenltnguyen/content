Every JavaScript object has a `[[Prototype]]`.  Getting a property on an object
first searches that object, then its `[[Prototype]]`, then that object's
`[[Prototype]]`, until the property is found or the chain ends.  The
`[[Prototype]]` chain is especially useful for
[object inheritance](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

ECMAScript 6 introduces ways to *mutate* `[[Prototype]]`.  This flexibility has
a cost: it substantially degrades performance.  **`[[Prototype]]` mutation harms
performance in *all* modern JavaScript engines.**  This article explains why
`[[Prototype]]` mutation is slow in *all* browsers and describes alternatives
that should be used instead.

## How JavaScript engines optimize property accesses

Objects are hashes, so theoretically (and in reality) property accesses take
constant time.  But "constant time" might be thousands of machine instructions. 
Fortunately, objects and properties are often "predictable", and in such cases
their underlying structure can also be predictable.  JITs can rely on this to
make predictable accesses faster.

Engines optimize by depending on the *order* properties are added to objects. 
Most properties are added to objects with quite similar ordering.  (Objects
routinely accessed using `obj[val]`-style random access are a notable
exception.)

```js
function Landmark(lat, lon, desc) {
  this.location = { lat: lat, long: lon };
  this.description = desc;
}
var lm1 = new Landmark(-90, 0, "South Pole");
var lm2 = new Landmark(-24.3756466, -128.311018, "Pitcairn Islands");
```

Every `Landmark` has properties `location` and `description` in that order. 
Each object literal storing latitude/longitude information has properties `lat`
and long in that order.  Subsequent code *could* delete a property.  But it's
unlikely, so engines can produce less-optimal code in such cases.  In
SpiderMonkey, the JavaScript engine in Firefox, a particular ordering of
properties (and some aspects of those properties, *not* including values) is
called a *shape*.  (V8's name for the concept is *structure ID*.)  If two
objects share a shape, their properties are stored identically.

Internally to engines, a (simplified) version of these ideas looks like this
C++:

```cpp
struct Property {
  Property* prev; // null if first property
  String name; // name of property
  unsigned int index; // index of its value in storage
};
using Shape = Property*;
struct Object {
  Shape shape;
  Value* properties;
  Object* prototype;
};
```

In the example, various JS expressions would correspond to this C++:

```cpp
lm1->properties[0]; // loc1.location
lm1->properties[1]; // loc1.description
lm2->properties[0].toObject()->properties[1]; // loc2.location.long
```

If an engine knows an object has a particular shape, it can assume *all*
property indexes for all properties on the object.  Accessing a particular
property is only a couple cheap pointer accesses.  It's easy for machine code to
check an object has a particular shape.  If it does, make assumptions for fast
code; if not, do things the slow way.

## Naively optimizing inherited properties

Many properties don't exist *directly* on the object: lookups often find
properties on the prototype chain.  Accesses to properties on prototypes is just
extra "hops" through the `prototype` field to the object containing the
property.  Optimizing *correctly* requires that no object along the way have the
property, so every hop must check that object's shape.

```js
var d = new Date();
d.toDateString(); // Date.prototype.toDateString

function Pair(x, y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }
Pair.prototype.sum = function() { return this.x + this.y; };

var p = new Pair(3, 7);
p.sum(); // Pair.prototype.sum
```

Engines take this quick-and-dirty approach in many cases.  But in especially
performance-sensitive JavaScript, this isn't good enough.

## Intelligently optimizing inherited properties

Predictable property accesses *usually* find the property a constant number of
hops along the `[[Prototype]]` chain; intervening objects *usually* don't
acquire new properties; the ultimate object *usually* won't have any properties
[deleted](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete).  Finally:
**`[[Prototype]]` mutation is rare**.  All these common assumptions are
necessary to avoid slow prototype-hopping.  Different engines choose different
approaches to intelligently optimize inherited properties.

*   The shape of the *ultimate* object containing the inherited can be checked.

    *   : In this case, a shape match must imply that no intervening object's
        `[[Prototype]]` has been modified.  Therefore, when an object's
        `[[Prototype]]` is mutated, every object along its `[[Prototype]]` chain
        must also have its shape changed.
        ````js
            var obj1 = {};
            var obj2 = Object.create(obj1);
            var obj3 = Object.create(obj2);

            // Objects whose shapes would change: obj3, obj2, obj1, Object.prototype
            obj3.__proto__ = {};
            ```

        ````
*   The shape of the object initially accessed can be checked.

    *   : Every object that might inherit through a changed-`[[Prototype]]` object
        must change, reflecting the `[[Prototype]]` mutation having happened
        ````js
            var obj1 = {};
            var obj2 = Object.create(obj1);
            var obj3 = Object.create(obj2);

            // Objects whose shapes would change: obj1, obj2, obj3
            obj1.__proto__ = {};
            ```

        ````

## Pernicious effects of `[[Prototype]]` mutation

`[[Prototype]]` mutation's adverse performance impact occurs in two phases: at
the time mutation occurs, and in subsequent execution.  First, **mutating
`[[Prototype]]` is slow**.  Second, **mutating `[[Prototype]]` slows down code
that interacts with mutated-`[[Prototype]]` objects**.

### Mutating `[[Prototype]] is slow`

While the spec considers mutating `[[Prototype]]` to be modifying a single
hidden property, real-world implementations are considerably more complex.  Both
shape-changing tactics described above require examining (and modifying) more
than one object.  Which approach modifies fewer objects in practice, depends
upon the workload.

### Mutated `[[Prototype]]`s slow down other code

The bad effects of `[[Prototype]]` mutation don't end once the mutation is
complete.  Because so many property-examination operations implicitly depend on
`[[Prototype]]` chains not changing, when engines observe a mutation, *an object
with mutated `[[Prototype]] "taints" all code the object flows through`*.  This
tainting flows through all code that ever observes a mutated-`[[Prototype]]`
object.  As a near-worst-case illustration, consider these patterns of behavior:

```js
var obj = {};
obj.__proto__ = { x: 3 }; // gratuitous mutation

var arr = [obj];
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++)
  arr.push({ x: i });

function f(v, i) {
  var elt = v[i];
  var r =  elt.x > 2 // pessimized
           ? elt
           : { x: elt.x + 1 };
  return r;
}
var c = f(arr, 0);
c.x; // pessimized: return value has unknown properties
c = f(arr, 1);
c.x; // still pessimized!

var arr2 = [c];
arr2[0].x; // pessimized
```

(Only code that runs many times is optimized, so this doesn't trigger *all*
these bad behaviors.  But every breakdown could happen if it appeared in "hot"
code.)

Recognizing exactly where a mutated-`[[Prototype]]` object flows, often across
multiple scripts, is extraordinarily difficult.  It depends on careful textual
analysis of the code and particular runtime behaviors.  Far-distant changes,
that trigger subtly different control flow, can taint previously-optimal code
paths with pessimal behavior.  *It's impossible to recognize all the places that
will become slower, **even for a JavaScript language implementer**.*

remaining constant.Mutation must, in addition to changing other objects' shapes,

But this requires storing *cross-object* information.

Cross-object information is different from shape, in that it can't easily be
checked.  One modification to this information may affect many locations, none
obviously connected to it: where to look to verify assumptions?  So instead of
checking the assumptions before use, *all* code making assumptions is
*invalidated* when a modification happens.  When a `[[Prototype]]` changes,
*all* code depending on it must be thrown away.  The operation
`obj.__proto__ = ...` is thus inherently slow.  And by throwing away
already-optimized code, it makes that code much slower when it runs later.

But it's worse than that.  When evaluating `obj.prop` sees an object whose
`[[Prototype]]` has been mutated, so much previously-known information about the
object becomes useless that SpiderMonkey considers the object to have
wholly-unknown characteristics.  Any code path that touches such an object in
the future will assume the worst.  Optimizing JIT engines assume that *future
execution is like past execution*.  If an object with mutated `[[Prototype]]` is
observed by some code, that code will likely observe more such objects. 
Therefore, **operations that interact with an object with mutated
`[[Prototype]]`, anywhere, in any scripts, are un-optimizable**.

The un-optimizability of objects with mutated `[[Prototype]]` is not
